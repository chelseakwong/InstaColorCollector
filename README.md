# instadownload
node.js-based instagram batch image + metadata downloader 

usage:

pretty easy.  just modify the 'searchTerm', 'startDate', and 'endDate' variables.  remember the dates are in js Date format, so they're a little wonky as to what's 0-based and what's 1-based.  then run it in node:

    node instadownload.js

and you should be off and running.
